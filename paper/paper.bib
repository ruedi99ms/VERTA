ABSTRACT = {This study systematically reviews the application of virtual reality (VR) in building evacuation scenarios in disaster contexts, highlighting its transformative potential to enhance preparedness, evacuation strategies, and safety training. Disasters such as fires, earthquakes, and multi-hazard emergencies pose significant challenges in densely populated urban environments, requiring innovative solutions beyond traditional methods. Analyzing 48 peer-reviewed studies (2014–2024) following PRISMA guidelines, this review focuses on VR applications in public buildings, transportation hubs, and high-risk workplaces, with VR simulations emerging as the predominant methodology. Key findings demonstrate VR’s ability to simulate realistic scenarios, improve spatial navigation, and optimize crowd dynamics and mobility accessibility. VR enhances evacuation efficiency and safety compliance by enabling adaptive training for diverse populations, including students, professionals, and vulnerable groups. In public and high-risk environments, VR addresses challenges such as visibility limitations, structural complexity, and the need for customized evacuation protocols. However, gaps remain in exploring multi-hazard environments and mixed-use spaces and ensuring scalability. Future research should integrate VR with artificial intelligence and machine learning for predictive and adaptive evacuation models. Expanding VR applications to underrepresented groups, including individuals with disabilities and the elderly, and collaborating with policymakers and urban planners are vital for translating research into practice. Overall, VR provides a scalable, adaptable, and inclusive solution for building evacuation preparedness, offering actionable insights to enhance resilience and safety in diverse architectural and disaster contexts. Its ability to transform evacuation strategies positions VR as a pivotal tool in advancing disaster management.},

abstract={With rising sea levels and possible storm intensification due to climate change, current United States urban coastal flood management strategies will be challenged. Due to limitations of current flood management strategies, evacuation is likely to become increasingly prominent in many coastal areas. Thus it is important to think critically about challenges for successful evacuation planning, particularly for vulnerable communities. This paper brings together the evacuation planning, climate change and environmental justice literatures. We describe the unique challenges that environmental justice communities face with evacuation, and identify best practice guidelines to improve the quality of evacuation planning for these communities. The guidelines presented, while not comprehensive, provide a framework for planners and policymakers to consider when developing evacuation plans, both for current and future climate conditions, and could improve the quality of evacuation planning.},

abstract = {Pedestrians often need to decide between different routes they can use to reach their intended destinations, both during emergencies and in their daily lives. This route-choice behavior is important in determining traffic management, evacuation efficiency and building design. Here, we use field observations and a virtual experiment to study the route choice behavior of pedestrians around obstacles delimiting exit routes and examine the influence of three factors, namely the local distance to route starting points and the pedestrian density and walking speeds along routes. Crucially, both field study and virtual experiment consider the same scenario which allows us to directly assess the validity of testing pedestrian behavior in virtual environments. We find that in both data sets the proportion of people who choose a closer exit route increases as the difference in distance between exit route starting points increases. Pedestrians’ choices in our data also depend on pedestrian density along routes, with people preferring less used routes. Our results thus confirm previously established route choice mechanisms and we can predict over 74% of choices based on these factors. The qualitative agreement in results between the field study and the virtual experiment suggests that in simple route-choice scenarios, such as the one we investigate here, virtual experiments can be a valid experimental technique for studying pedestrian behavior. We therefore provide much-needed empirical support for the emerging paradigm of experiments in virtual environments.}

They can also be used to predict traffic flow and congestion levels, which is essential for traffic management and control. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness and limitations of various game theory (GT) based models used in route choice modelling. The manuscript draws upon the theoretical foundations of game theory to explore the complex decision-making processes of travelers in transportation networks, focusing on factors such as travel time, congestion. The manuscript discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing game theory-based models in practice, including the data requirements, model calibration, and computational complexity. These factors are considered in relation to the suitability of different game theory-based models, including cooperative, non-cooperative, and evolutionary games. The comparative critiques presented in this manuscript provide guidance for future research directions in the field of private route choice modelling, aimed at academic researchers, engineers, policymakers, and industrial communities.}

abstract = {With continuously increasing tourism volume, overcrowded tourist attractions pose a great challenge for tourists during emergency evacuations. This study investigates the factors that influence tourists' choice of evacuation routes in emergency scenarios characterized by high uncertainty, particularly on the role of crowd density. By employing discrete choice experiments through virtual reality, we analyzed the effects of crowd density and its interaction with various route characteristics through a binomial logistic regression model. Our results demonstrate that crowd density nonlinearly impacts tourists' evacuation route choices. Additionally, factors such as emergency evacuation signage and route familiarity moderate the relationship between crowd density and evacuation route choice. These findings provide critical insights into tourists' decision-making processes during emergency evacuations, thereby contributing to the formulation of more effective emergency management strategies.}

abstract = {In the event of a fire emergency in the built environment, occupants face a range of evacuation decisions, including the choice of exits. An important question from the standpoint of evacuation safety is how evacuees make these choices and what factors affect their choices. Understanding how humans weigh these (often) competing factors is essential knowledge for evacuation planning and safe design. Here, we use immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experiments to investigate, in controlled settings, how these decision trade-offs are made using empirical data and econometric choice models. In each VR scenario, participants are confronted with choices between trade-offs between choosing exits that are familiar to them, exits that are less occupied, exits that are nearer to them and exits to which visibility is less affected by fire smoke. The marginal role of these competing factors on their decisions is quantified in a discrete choice model. Post-experiment questionnaires also determine factors such as participants' their perceived realism and emotion evoked by the VR evacuation experience. Results indicate that none of the investigated factors dominated the others in terms of their influence on exit choices. The participants exhibited patterns of multi-attribute conjoint decision-making, consistent with the recent findings in the literature. While lack of familiarity and the presence of smoke both negatively affected the desirability of an exit to evacuees, neither solely determined exit choice. It was also observed that prioritisation of the said factors by participants changed during the repeated scenarios, when compared to the first scenario that they experienced. Results have implications for both fire safety designs and future VR evacuation experiment designs. These empirical models can also be employed as input into computer simulations of building evacuation.}

abstract = {In complex building evacuations, continuous decision-making is unavoidable to make a sequence of route choices at intersections. Evacuees can change their initial decisions with the environmental context changes to deal with the uncertainties of the evacuation. However, this decision-changing phenomenon in evacuation wayfinding has not been well explained. Therefore, this study investigates the decision-changing behavior in crowd evacuation. The influence of two typical crowd flow modes (i.e., symmetric split and asymmetric split crowd flow) on human decision changes in evacuation wayfinding is explored. The results show that evacuees are likely to change their initial route choice decision under the influence of crowd flows, and asymmetric crowd flow significantly reinforces this trend. Moreover, crowd flow modes significantly affected participants' wayfinding performance, including evacuation time, distance, and speed. This study provides behavioral observations and empirical evidence of the persistent effects of crowd flows on evacuees' wayfinding decisions changing and performance during the evacuation.}

ABSTRACT = {This study employed Virtual Reality (VR) technology to investigate the influence of corridor directional configuration on evacuation wayfinding behavior in underground spaces. The study designed two virtual underground space fire evacuation scenarios with different forms of intersections, and recruited 115 volunteers to participate in the experiment.The results indicated that corridor directional configuration significantly affected participants’ fire evacuation wayfinding behavior. At Y-shaped and T-shaped intersections with left and right turning options, participants showed a preference for choosing the right-side corridor. At ┡-shaped and ┩-shaped intersections with straight and turning options, participants tended to choose the straight path. Individual factors (such as gender, evacuation experience, and professional background) did not demonstrate significant effects on wayfinding choices in this study, though they may produce different evacuation outcomes in various scenarios. In practical evacuation design, corridor directional configuration should be organically integrated with other environmental factors to reinforce directional preferences and more effectively guide evacuation. The findings provide scientific evidence for underground space evacuation route design, which can be used to optimize evacuation signage and path configuration, thereby improving evacuation efficiency and safety. Future research could be conducted in more complex environments, considering additional variables to gain a more comprehensive understanding of evacuation behavior.},

abstract = {Research on evacuation from natural disasters has been published across the peer-reviewed literature among several disparate disciplinary outlets and has suggested a wide variety of predictors of evacuation behavior. We conducted a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the current literature on demographic, storm-related, and psychosocial correlates of natural disaster evacuation behavior. Eighty-three eligible papers utilizing 83 independent samples were identified. Risk perception was a consistent positive predictor of evacuation, as were several demographic indicators, prior evacuation behavior, and having an evacuation plan. The influence of prior experiences, self-efficacy, personality, and links between expected and actual behavior were examined less frequently. Prospective, longitudinal designs are relatively uncommon. Although difficult to conduct in postdisaster settings, more prospective, methodologically rigorous studies would bolster inferences. Results synthesize the current body of literature on evacuation behavior and can help inform the design of more effective predisaster evacuation warnings and procedures.},
