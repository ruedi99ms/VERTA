As extreme events become more common due to climate change, the need for evacuations will grow as well. For example, city blocks may need to be evacuated due to flooding, or villages due to wildfires. The characteristics of real-world extreme events vary greatly (e.g., spatial distribution, their impacts, strength, etc.). Because of this variability, it is difficult to draw conclusions from one event to another. 

Virtual Reality (VR) has become an increasingly important study tool in this field because it enables researchers to analyze people's behaviors in controlled scenarios. Route choice is a crucial factor for successful evacuations, especially when there is no guidance e.g. from trained evacuation helpers. Routes can be thought of as "correct" when they lead away from the extreme event, or "incorrect" when they lead toward it. However, with limited information available - such as during internet outages - people can't always choose the correct and most efficient path to safety. 

This is why researchers, urban planners, and evacuation helpers need to understand how to design evacuation routes as intuitively as possible. But to do this effectively, they first need to understand how evacuees actually behave.

This is where the Virtual Environment Route and Trajectory Analyzer (VERTA) comes in. VERTA addresses a critical gap in analyzing route choice behavior from VR evacuation experiments. While VR enables controlled behavioral studies, extracting meaningful insights from movement trajectories is not straightforward. Researchers need specialized methods to identify where and how route decisions are made at intersections. This task becomes particularly challenging when dealing with varying movement speeds, incomplete information, and the need to distinguish between correct and incorrect route choices. 

VERTA provides researchers with standardized, reproducible methods to analyze these complex behavioral patterns. This enables systematic comparison across different evacuation scenarios and experimental conditions. Such capability is essential for building an evidence base that can inform evacuation route design. It allows researchers to move beyond individual case studies and identify generalizable patterns in how people navigate under stress and uncertainty. By making route choice analysis accessible through both programmatic and interactive interfaces, VERTA helps translate VR experimental data into actionable insights for urban planners and evacuation management professionals.

# Research Impact Statement

We have already used VERTA in the "RESCUE" (Routing Efficiency Study of 2D and 3D Cartography for Urban Evacuations in Emergencies) research project. It has given us valuable insights in the route choice behavior and evacuation efficiency of a simulated flooding event in Frankfurt am Main (Germany). #Add bib output
